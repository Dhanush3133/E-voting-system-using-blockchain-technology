# E-voting-system-using-blockchain-technology
This project implements a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof electronic voting (e-voting) system using blockchain technology. By leveraging the decentralized, immutable, and transparent nature of blockchain, the system ensures that:

Every vote is recorded accurately

Votes cannot be altered or deleted

Voter anonymity is preserved

The entire election process is verifiable and auditable

This solution addresses the common problems in traditional voting systems such as vote rigging, fake votes, double voting, and lack of transparency.
